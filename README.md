# mindmuse
Mindmuse is a simple web-based quote generator that displays motivational quotes along with their authors. When the user clicks a button, a random quote is selected from an array of quotes, ensuring that the same quote is not displayed consecutively. The quotes are stored as objects using a constructor function, enhancing the organization and scalability of the code. This project demonstrates basic JavaScript concepts such as arrays, functions, event listeners, and DOM manipulation.
